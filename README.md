Interactive Slicers: Filters for Department, Present City, Gender, Employee Status, Employment Type, and Location (Branch Office, Head Office, Remote) to enable dynamic data exploration.

Data Sources
The dashboard is built using data from an Excel file, specifically the following sheets (converted to CSV for this repository):

emp_data_.xlsx - Analysis.csv

emp_data_.xlsx - Emp Data Reg Dashboard.csv

emp_data_.xlsx - EMP Data.csv

A PDF document (data_emp.pdf) was also provided, which appears to contain visual representations and snippets of the dashboard's design and underlying data.

Dashboard Overview
The dashboard provides a quick and intuitive way to understand employee demographics and resignation patterns. Key metrics are prominently displayed at the top, followed by various charts and graphs that offer deeper insights. Slicers on the left panel allow users to drill down into specific segments of the data.

How to Use
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Employee-Data-Dashboard.git
cd Employee-Data-Dashboard

Open the Dashboard: Depending on the implementation (e.g., if it's a Power BI dashboard or an Excel file), open the primary dashboard file. If it's a web-based dashboard, open the index.html file in your browser.

Interact with Slicers: Use the checkboxes and filters on the left side of the dashboard to dynamically filter and view data based on Department, City, Gender, Employment Status, Employment Type, and Location.

Analyze Charts: Observe the changes in the bar charts and pie chart as you apply filters to gain insights into employee distribution and trends.

Review Detailed Data: The detailed employee table provides granular information for selected filters.

Technologies Used
The original dashboard appears to be created using a business intelligence tool (likely Power BI or similar, given the screenshot format).

For setting up this project, you would typically need:

Microsoft Excel: To manage and update the raw employee data.

Business Intelligence Tool (e.g., Power BI, Tableau): If you intend to recreate or further develop the interactive dashboard.

CSV Files: For data transfer and compatibility across different platforms.

Setup Instructions (Local)
If you have the original dashboard file (e.g., a Power BI .pbix file or an Excel workbook with the dashboard), follow the instructions for that specific tool.

For the CSV files provided:

Place the .csv files in a designated data/ directory within your project.

If you plan to build a web-based dashboard, you can use:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For front-end development.

D3.js / Chart.js / Plotly.js: For interactive data visualizations in a web environment.

Python (Pandas, Dash, Flask): For data processing and creating web applications with dashboards.
